## Features

### Completed
- [x] Project initialization
- [x] Creation of database connections for PostgreSQL and SQLite

  - [x] `GET /lots` — list of active lots
  - [x] `PATCH /{lot_id}/status` — update lot status. Broadcasting websocket
- [x] Structuring of base code (separate folders for models, services, and endpoints)
- [x] User account creation with JWT-based authentication
- [x] Creation and update of bids based on the authenticated user
- [x] WebSocket for real-time lot status updates
  - [x] `WEBSOCKET /ws/lots/{lot_id}` - endpoint for subscribing to events
- [x] WebSocket python cli client

### Optional
- [ ] Writing tests using pytest
- [ ] Sending WebSocket messages to a Telegram bot
- [ ] Configuring secure environment variables, e.g., password
- [ ] Using Redis or RabbitMQ as a broker for Websocket
- [ ] Using Redis for storing user sessions
- [ ] Using Celery to execute Websocket Tasks
- [ ] Websocket server refactored to be easier to scale. Separate FastAPI code and WebSocket code
